# CENG319 Software Project Assignment 3 - GridView
Tutorial Blog (GridView)

## Introduction
GridView is a subclass that comes from AdapterView. GridView is a ViewGroup that displays gridView items onto a 2D scrolling grid. If the code in the layout is not fixed or pre-determined, a layout of subclasses from AdapterView can be utilized to generate the layout with views at runtime. When implementing gridView there are these things called gridView items. These gridView items could be in text or in a picture format. The format from where the gridView items are displayed are in columns and rows. GridView items can also be considered as buttons. These items can also be clickable which allow the user to move from one activity to another. GridView is also from a subclass of AdapterView. Not to be confused with GridLayout. Although GridLayout and GridView are very much the same, GridLayout places its items onto a rectangular grid instead of GridViews 2D grid. <br>

## History
Seeing as GridView is a subclass of AdapterView, AdapterView was introduced in API Level 1, which is one of the oldest APIs to be used in the android app development, it was invented for so long that it does not even have a code name unlike the future APIs. AdapterView is a group of widgets otherwise known as views. It has many components of subclasses such as ListView, Spinner, Gallery, etc. All of which are commonly used in android app development. <br>

## The major methods/attributes
Firstly, you are required to have two java files, however the 2nd java file does not require a xml file included with it (in this case the imagechanger), but you can have one if needed. In your MainActivity.java it would have:<br>

<b>gV.setAdapter(new ImageChange(this));</b><br>

ImageChange is the 2nd java file and is being called by setAdapter. setAdapter allows data to go through the GridView. gV is a variable that in this example, it is used to identify the GridView layout which is found by findViewById. It can be any variable of the developersâ€™ choice. 

<b>gV.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener()</b><br>

The setOnItemClicker is a callback method that tells the AdapterView that the item is being clicked.<br>

<b>public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> parent, View view, int positionID, long id)</b><br>
This method will give a function to all items that are included in your gridView. In multiple cases when an item is clicked, developers can set them to their specific needs such as the usage of, intents, toast, exit, etc.<br>

In your 2nd java file (in this case from the example ImageChange.java) it would have:<br>

<b>public class ImageChange extends BaseAdapter</b><br>

BaseAdapter will allow the gridView to have basic implementation of adapter.<br>

<b>public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)</b><br>

This gives your images the correct placements of where they should be by using the item ID position. Also it gives the developer options to how big they want their images to be.<br>

Additional methods that are used, but are not absolutely necessary.<br>

<b>getItem()</b>- Will give the developer the item position on the gridView<br>

<b>getItemId</b> - Returns row ID<br>


## Example Project
In the example provided in the repository, there are 2 java files and 1 xml file. The 2 java files all relate to the main functionality of the gridView, however the images implemented in this example are optional and are not a requirement for a functioning gridView. If planned on using intents you may have to add statements that inform your program to call the correct ItemID to bring to the correct intent. Another thing is that the images used in this example are all added to drawable and are all called from the 2nd java file (in this example is ImageChange.java).<br>
